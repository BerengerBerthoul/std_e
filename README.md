## Introduction ##
`std_e` (for "std extended") is a C++17 library. It contains general-purpose data structures and algorithms (multi-dimensional array, constexpr std algorithms, utilities...). Hopefully, one day, these functionnalities will be provided by the C++ standard library.


## Dependencies ##
`std_e` is a C++17 library. It depends on the standard library only.
