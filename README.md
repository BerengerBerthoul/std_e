## Introduction ##
`std_e` (for "std extended") is a C++17 library. It contains general-purpose data structures and algorithms (multi-dimensional array, constexpr std algorithms, utilities...). Hopefully, one day, these functionnalities will be provided by the C++ standard library.


## Dependencies ##
`std_e` is a header-only C++17 library. Its functionnality depends only on the standard library. The use of Cmake for building tests and installing depends also on the `project_utils` library (can be included as a git submodule, see <https://github.com/BerengerBerthoul/project_utils>).
